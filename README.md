# gogh-alacritty-themes

I wrote a script to convert the theme files from the wonderful [Mayccoll/Gogh](https://github.com/Mayccoll/Gogh) repository into .yaml files compatiple with the [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) terminal emulator.

I checked each theme against the screenshots provided in the Gogh repo to make sure the output files were accurate and there were no errors.

These themes can be applied by either pasting the contents of a theme file into the approprate location in your alacritty.yml config file or by using a theme switcher. I use [rajasegar/alacritty-themes](https://github.com/rajasegar/alacritty-themes) for example.
